      "body": "Teams will be ranked according to the number of problems they complete correctly. For example, a team that completes 5 problems correctly will finish ahead of a team that completes 4 problems correctly. There is no penalty for problems that are not solved. In the event of a tie, the teams that tied will be ranked according to the total accumulated time taken by each team. Accumulated time is measured as follows: for each problem completed correctly, the time from the start of the contest to the completion of the problem is calculated and added to the team\u2019s total accumulated time. Furthermore, 10 minutes per incorrect submission of a problem are added to the total time for that problem. For example, if a team turned in two incorrect solutions to a problem (when they turn them in doesn\u2019t matter) and correctly solve the problem after 2 hours, the total solution time for that problem will be 2 hours and 20 minutes. If two teams complete the same number of problems, the team that has an accumulated time of 120 minutes would be ranked ahead of the team that has an accumulated time of 140 minutes. Live standings are available for viewing on the leaderboard page of the competition interface."
